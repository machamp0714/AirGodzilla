# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0] - 2019-08-06

### Changed

- If xstring literals (command line calls surrounded by backticks) break, then we indent and place the command on a new line. Previously, this was resulting in new lines getting added each time the code was formatted. Now this happens correctly. (Thanks to @dudeofawesome for the report.)
- When a `while` or `until` loop modifies a `begin...end` statement, it must remain in the modifier form or else it changes sematic meaning. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
begin
  foo
end while bar
```

cannot be transformed into:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
while bar
  foo
end
```

because that would never execute `foo` if `bar` is falsy, whereas in the initial example it would have. (Thanks to @krachtstefan for the report.)

- When transforming a block into the `Symbol#to_proc` syntax from within a list of arguments inside of an `aref` node (i.e., `foo[:bar].each`), we can't put the block syntax inside the brackets. (Thanks to @jviney for the report.)
- Values for the `return` keyword that broke the line were previously just printed as they were, which breaks if you have a block expression like an `if` or `while`. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
return foo ? bar : baz
```

if the line was set to very short would be printed as:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
return if foo
  bar
else
  baz
end
```

which wouldn't work. Instead, they now get printed with parentheses around the value, as in:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
return(
  if foo
    bar
  else
    baz
  end
)
```

(Thanks to @jakeprime for the report.)

- When switching from a double-quoted string to a single-quoted string that contained escaped double quotes, the backslashes would stay in the string. As in:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
"Foo \"Bar\" Baz"
```

would get formatted as:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
'Foo \"Bar\" Baz'
```

but now gets formatted as:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
'Foo "Bar" Baz'
```

(Thanks to @jakeprime for the report.)

## [0.14.0] - 2019-07-17

### Added

- Support for pattern matching for variables and array patterns. Currently waiting on Ripper support for hash patterns. For examples, check out the [test/js/patterns.test.js](test/js/patterns.test.js) file.

### Changed

- if/else blocks that had method calls on the end of them that were also transformed into ternaries need to have parens added to them. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
if foo
  1
else
  2
end.to_s
```

now correctly gets transformed into:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
(foo ? 1 : 2).to_s
```

(Thanks to @jviney for the report.)

- Fixed a bug where multiple newlines at the end of the file would cause a crash. (Thanks to @acrewdson for the report.)
- If a variable is assigned inside of the predicate of a conditional, then we can't change it into the single-line version as this breaks. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
if foo = 1
  foo
end
```

must stay the same. (Thanks to @jviney for the report.)

## [0.13.0] - 2019-07-05

### Added

- Added `locStart` and `locEnd` functions to support `--cursor-offset`.

### Changed

- Comments inside of `do...end` blocks that preceeded `call` nodes were associating the comment with the `var_ref` instead of the `call` itself. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
foo.each do |bar|
  # comment
  bar.baz
  bar.baz
end
```

would get printed as

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
foo.each do |bar|
  # comment
  bar
    .baz
  bar.baz
end
```

but now gets printed correctly. (Thanks to @xipgroc for the report.)

- Double splats inside a hash were previously failing to print. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
{ foo: "bar", **baz }
```

would fail to print, but now works. (Thanks to @petevk for the report.)

## [0.12.3] - 2019-05-16

### Changed

- [INTERNAL] Move arg, assign, constant, flow, massign, operator, scope, and statement nodes into their own files.
- [INTERNAL] Move `@int`, `access_ctrl`, `assocsplat`, `block_var`, `else`, `number_arg`, `super`, `undef`, `var_ref`, and `var_ref` as well as various call and symbol nodes into appropriate files.
- Better support for excessed commas in block args. Previously `proc { |x,| }` would add an extra space, but now it does not.
- [INTERNAL] Add a lot more documentation to the parser.
- Previously, the unary `not` operator inside a ternary (e.g., `a ? not(b) : c`) would break because it wouldn't add parentheses, but now it adds them. (Thanks to @glejeune for the report.)
- `if` and `unless` nodes used to not be able to handle if a comment was the only statement in the body. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
if foo
  # comment
end
```

would get printed as

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
# comment if foo
```

Now the `if` and `unless` printers check for the presence of single comments.

- Fixes an error where `command` nodes within `def` nodes would fail to format if it was only a single block argument. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
def curry(&block)
  new &block
end
```

would fail, but now works. (Thanks to @JoshuaKGoldberg for the report.)

- Comments on lines with array references were previously deleting the array references entirely. For example,

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ruby
array[index] # comment
```

would previously result in `array[]`, but now prints properly. (Thanks to @xipgroc for the report.)

## [0.12.2] - 2019-04-30

### Changed

- When symbol literal hash keys end with `=`, they cannot be transformed into hash labels.
- Fixed when blocks on methods with no arguments are transformed into `to_proc` syntax. (Thanks to @xipgroc for the report.)

## [0.12.1] - 2019-04-22

### Changed

- If a lambda literal is nested under a `command` or `command_call` node anywhere in the heirarchy, then it needs to use the higher-precedence `{ ... }` braces as opposed to the `do ... end` delimiters.
- Calling `super` with a block and no args was causing the parser to fail when attempting to inspect lambda nodes. (Thanks to @jpickwell for the report.)
- Support better breaking within interpolation by grouping the interpolated content.

## [0.12.0] - 2019-04-18
